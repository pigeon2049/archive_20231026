Slack is a real-time messaging app that uses web and real-time APIs to handle user sessions and chat messages. It runs on the LAMP stack and uses MySQL as an eventually consistent database. The messaging architecture includes a PHP monolith for CRUD operations, a gateway server for WebSocket communication, and consistent hashing to map channels to gateway servers. Additionally, Slack uses a job queue for non-critical tasks, SSL termination with Envoy Edge proxy, and a snapshot service for low latency and high performance.
