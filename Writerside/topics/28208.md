Valve announced Wednesday that it has released SteamVR 2.0, launching the major update exactly a month after the surprise launch of the SteamVR 2.0 beta in September.

“In this release we’re bringing all of what’s new and exciting on the Steam platform into VR,” [Valve says in a Steam post](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F250820%2Fview%2F3739736044830869589). “This is our first big step in a larger ongoing effort to better unify the Steam ecosystem for all users, providing a more consistent experience across devices. This update also allows us to add new Steam features in the future much faster and more frequently.”

SteamVR 2.0 has been a long time coming, with Valve saying [in a 2019 year-in-review Steam post](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697229969000435735) that it was “hard at work” on the update. Here are some of Valve’s highlights for what you’ll find in SteamVR 2.0, which match pretty closely to what Valve [pointed to in September](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23890229/valve-steamvr-2-0-beta-announce):

> Most of the current features of Steam and Steam Deck are now part of SteamVR
> 
> Updated keyboard with support for dual-cursor typing, new languages, emojis, and themes
> 
> Integration of Steam Chat and Voice Chat
> 
> Improved Store that puts new and popular VR releases front and center
> 
> Easy access to Steam notifications

Interestingly, the update arrived without any sort of announcement of new hardware — Valve is rumored to be working on some kind of new VR headset, though it’s unclear what form it might take. A mystery gadget passed [radio certification in South Korea in September](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23863862/valve-galileo-sephiroth-1030-south-korea-radio-certification), which could point toward a potentially imminent hardware announcement of some sort, VR headset or not. And Valve has also reportedly been developing [a standalone VR headset codenamed “Deckard,”](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22699914/valve-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-prototype-development) which, if released, would compete with Meta’s standalone Quest VR headsets.
