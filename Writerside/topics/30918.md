The Naive Bayes algorithm is a foundational pillar in supervised learning. It is characterized by its 'naive' assumption that features are independent. There are different types of Naive Bayes classifiers tailored to specific data types. The algorithm has strengths in elegance, efficiency, text classification, handling high-dimensional data, multiclass versatility, and data efficiency. However, it also has limitations in the independence assumption, expressiveness, handling continuous data, sensitivity to data imbalance, regression tasks, noisy data, and limited feature importance interpretation.
