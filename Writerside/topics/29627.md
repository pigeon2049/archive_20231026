The article discusses Ken Thompson's Turing award lecture on supply chain security and the creation of a backdoored C compiler. It explains the three steps outlined in the lecture to modify the compiler and compile the 'login' program with a backdoor. The article also highlights the timeline of the code, controlled deployment, and a modern variant of the backdoor. It concludes with reflections on the importance of building from trusted sources and the need for reproducible builds and enhanced computing security.
