Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan told Pope Francis in a phone call on Thursday that Israel's attacks on Gaza amounted to a massacre, and that the silence of international community was "embarrasing," the presidency said.

In the call, Erdogan said that all countries must raise their voice against the humanitarian crisis in the region, according to a statement by the Turkish presidency.
