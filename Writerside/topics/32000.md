Twilio has removed its chat API and video live streaming API, but still offers its Conversations API for omnichannel customer support. Stream Chat provides APIs and SDKs to help developers build in-app chat, offering advantages such as flexible SDKs, offline support, global edge network, engaging features, and fast technical support. Twilio falls short in terms of low concurrent connections, limited SDKs, low MAU counts, channel limitations, unpredictable pricing, and slow technical support.
