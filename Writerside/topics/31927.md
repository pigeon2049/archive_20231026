Renewed selling on fears of a recession dragged the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) lower on Friday and pushed the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) into correction territory.

The 30-stock Dow fell 366.71 points, or 1.12% to close at 32,417.59. The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) slipped 0.48% to finish the session at 4,117.37, closing 10.3% lower from this year's peak on July 31. The Dow was pressured by declines in [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) after CEO Jamie Dimon said he [planned to sell 1 million shares next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/jamie-dimon-to-sell-jpmorgan-shares.html).

The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) held 0.38% higher to 12,643.01, thanks to shares of Amazon. [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) added more than 6% after [the e-commerce giant](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2023.html) trounced analysts' expectations for revenue and earnings in the third quarter. Other megacap tech stocks such as [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) followed Amazon shares higher.

The S&P 500 entered correction territory on Friday.

All three major averages registered steep weekly losses. The Dow and S&P 500 are down 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively, for the week. The Nasdaq has fallen 2.6% in that time, dragged down from steep weekly declines in [Meta Platforms](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) and Google-parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/).

"We still have a shaky economic outlook. So while the third quarter GDP print was extraordinarily high, I think everybody still expects that the US economy is going to slow down. The only question there is how much is it going to slow down and how fast," said Dave Sekera, chief U.S. market strategist at Morningstar.

The decline in key tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory after falling more than 10% from its closing high in July on Wednesday. This week also saw the index record its worst trading day since February.

Disappointing earnings have pressured the market this week. Ford dropped 14% week to date after the company missed third-quarter expectations and pulled its guidance for the year, citing the UAW strike. [Chevron](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CVX/) shares were down 13% on the week, after the energy giant reported earnings.

Traders also weighed new inflation data after the core [personal consumption expenditures reading for September](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/key-fed-inflation-gauge-rose-0point3percent-as-expected-in-september-spending-tops-estimate.html) was released ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week. Core PCE increased 0.3% in last month and 3.7% year over year, matching estimates from economists polled by Dow Jones. Consumer spending increased 0.7%, however, surpassing estimates of 0.5%. PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.

Dexcom bumps up forecast. JPMorgan says this could be a sign it's time to reenter the stock
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysts are pointing to [Dexcom's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DXCM/) latest results as proof that new weight loss drugs like [Novo Nordisk's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOVO.B-DK/) Wegovy won't be the death knell for medtech stocks. Dexcom shares are up nearly 13% in midday trading after the maker of continous glucose monitors significantly raised its annual forecast.

"We think this great quarter was the sign that investors were waiting for to reenter shares, and at current levels would be buyers," JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in a reserach note. Marcus bumped up his price target by $5 to $125.

Dexcom shares have fallen about 20% since the start of the year.

As CNBC Pro has reported, Marcus [has been making the case that GLP-1 utilization](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/11/as-obesity-drug-stocks-soared-these-stocks-fell-too-far-analysts-say.html) can actually boost demand for continous glucose monitoring, which has become the "gold standard" diabetic patients. And, he has said, for those who are trying to lose weight, it can provide information that is helpful with diet changes.

Other diabetes device makers saw their shares spike at the open, but the stocks are still positive but off of their highs. [Tandem Diabetes Care](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TNDM/) and [Insulet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PODD/) were both recently more than 1%.

It's likely to remain a tough road for these stocks, however. Several analysts said the earnings reinforced the bullish case for Dexcom, but they still expect multiple contraction for the sector and actually brought their price targets down.

Bitcoin heading for best week since June, but could be tested at FOMC meeting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=/) is on pace to post its best week since June, after a [big rally earlier this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/bitcoin-crosses-34000-to-the-highest-since-may-2022-on-etf-hopes.html) pushed it out of the narrow range it had been stuck in for much of this year.

The coin is on pace to end the week higher by 14% at the $33,000 level, according to Coin Metrics. At about $1,770, [ether](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETH.CM=/) is heading for a 10% weekly gain. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next.

Investors are watching closely to see if bitcoin can find a new floor at current levels. Next week it will get its first testing ground with the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, which will begin Tuesday. Callie Cox, an analyst at investment company eToro, noted that bitcoin tends to do better than stocks on Fed days, having outperformed the S&P 500 on 10 out of the last 13.

"Next week could be a real test for crypto," she said. "Industry news is exciting, but I worry that investors are forgetting that we're in an aggressively high rate environment. The Fed will probably reaffirm higher rates in its comments next week too. That could be a tough pill to swallow."

"I wouldn't be shocked if Powell entertains the idea of rate cuts," she added. "Inflation has made a lot of progress, and lately, his language has been more balanced than usual. Powell could be tough, but any semblance of flexibility could entice people back into risky investments like crypto."

Vanguard will not pursue a bitcoin ETF, CEO Buckley says
--------------------------------------------------------

Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC on Friday that the massive asset manager will not be pursuing a bitcoin ETF like some of its competitors, including [Blackrock](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BLK/).

"Just like we don't use gold as an asset class for our clients. It's not that people can't invest in there. We look at asset classes as what belongs in a long-term portfolio, what has intrinsic values, what has cash flows to it. And those are the asset classes we steer people towards," Buckley said.

The Vanguard CEO also said that investors should stick with their long-term investment plans instead of shifting heavily into cash of short-term bonds for high yields.

"The fundamentals of investing have not changed. Bonds are great for ballast ... but you need the equities for growth," Buckley said.

U.S. companies doing better than European names this earnings cycle, says JPMorgan
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly 40% of companies in the U.S. and Europe have posted their quarterly earnings thus far. Among those who have reported their results, U.S. companies are faring better than their European counterparts, according to JPMorgan.

In the S&P 500, 78% of companies who reported their earnings have beat earnings estimates and posted 12% year-over-year earnings growth. By comparison, just 57% of the Stoxx600 companies that have reported so far have topped earnings estimates. Third-quarter earnings have fallen 8% from the prior year. The bulk of the earnings weakness in Europe has been driven by the commodities sector, says JPMorgan.

"While it is still early in the season, we note that so far European top-line delivery is exceptionally weak," equity strategist Mislav Matejka wrote in a Friday note.

Physical oil market is weaker than prices are predicting, says Citi's Morse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oil ticked higher Friday as concerns rose over the conflict spreading in the Middle East, but there's a "geopolitical premium" in prices, according to Edward Morse, global head of commodities strategy at Citi.

"The physical oil market is really a lot weaker than where the prices are predicting at the moment," he told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Friday. " People have been exaggerating the oil market immediate implications of whatever might happen – it looks like nothing might happen on the immediate future that's going to affect prices."

"The physical market is pointing in a different direction from the volatility but we're still a good $10 below where the peaks were last month," he added.

[West Texas Intermediate](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@CL.1/) crude was higher by 0.64% on Friday, while [Brent](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@LCO.1/) crude futures added 0.82%.

Stocks are 'poised' for a bounce, strategist says
-------------------------------------------------

After the recent period of tough trading, the stock market should be due for a rally, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.

"Given how bearish the financial markets have become, and how nearly all the metrics associated with oversold conditions are pointing to an impending 'relief' or 'oversold' rally, markets appear poised for a bounce," Krosby said.

Krosby said many market participants hope that post-selloff bounce can turn into a year-end rally, though it may now be unexpected. She also noted that the escalating conflict in the Middle East is weighing on investors going into the weekend, pointing specifically to news of the [U.S. fighter jets striking Syria](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/27/israel-hamas-war-updates-and-latest-news-on-gaza-conflict.html) as reason for concern.

"Clearly, the hope is that it leads to the rally that takes the market into the year end," she said. "But the more traders and investors alike give up on that possibility, the higher the chances the market turns and delivers a solid finish to the year."

Cathie Wood says the economy is weaker than data suggest
--------------------------------------------------------

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said the economy may be weaker than data suggest as a number of companies have been reporting disappointing sales in this earnings season.

"Government statistics do not seem to be capturing how weak the economy is," Wood said in a note on X, formerly known as Twitter, Thursday evening. "Many companies are reporting shockingly weak revenues."

She pointed to [UPS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UPS/)' delivery volume growth in the U.S., which is worse today than in the 2007-2009 period. The number dropped another 11% last quarter, following a nearly two-year decline, she said.

The widely followed investor has been betting on stronger-than-expected deflationary forces, which could bring down bond yields. Lower rates could make the present value of any future earnings and cash flows of Wood's growth companies worth more.
