_Forbes_ [launched](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-spotlights/2023/10/26/forbes-launches-new-generative-ai-search-tool-adelaide-powered-by-google-cloud/) a beta version of a generative AI search platform built with Google Cloud to provide personalized searches for readers.

The platform is called [Adelaide](https://www.forbes.com/adelaide/?sh=6022f8255e02) — named after the wife of _Forbes’_ founder, B.C. Forbes. Readers can ask specific questions or input general topic areas and get recommended articles about their query, along with a summarized answer to whatever they asked... as long as it’s within _Forbes’_ coverage scope. Adelaide trained on _Forbes_ stories but only covered the past 12 months of its news and list coverage.

Vadim Supitskiy, chief digital and information officer at _Forbes_, said the publication wanted to increase engagement with both search and its stories.

“Engagement with search has been pretty standard for us, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to innovate using generative AI and boost the number of users that look for information,” Supitskiy told _The Verge_.

Readers can tap the Adelaide button on the website (or go directly to the Adelaide beta page) and ask questions like “Who is the richest person in Nebraska?” Using the publication’s library of news stories, opinion pieces, and lists, Adelaide will create a summary about Warren Buffett and then show related articles the user may want to read. In a demo, Supitskiy also showed people can continue the conversation with Adelaide with follow-up questions. The platform remembers the previous question and will surface more information about Buffett and different articles.

Other media companies have begun rolling out generative AI tools, separate from the [AI-generated articles](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23785645/go-media-ai-generated-articles-gizmodo-av-club-artificial-intelligence-bots) that have [recently caused controversy](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23931530/gannett-ai-product-reviews-site-reviewed-union-newsguild). In August, _Macworld, PCWorld, Tech Advisor,_ and _TechHive_ [added an AI chatbot](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23844868/ai-chatbot-macworld-pcworld-journalism-smart-answers) to their sites, allowing readers to ask questions and get answers based on their articles.

Supitskiy said that while Adelaide is the first generative AI tool built by _Forbes_, it is not the first time the publication worked with AI. It created Bertie in 2019, an AI-powered tool that provided _Forbes_ journalists with suggestions about their writing style. Both Adelaide and Bertie were built using tools from Google Cloud. Supitskiy said _Forbes_ made Adelaide on top of Google’s generative AI APIs. It also released ForbesOne in 2021, a machine learning platform that helps create personalized recommendations for users.

_Forbes_ has high hopes for Adelaide, and while it doesn’t have a timeline yet for a full rollout, Supitskiy wants to eventually expand Adelaide’s knowledge base to its entire archive, dating back to 1917, when _Forbes_ magazine was founded.
