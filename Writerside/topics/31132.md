Unity introduces Community Solutions, a suite of products designed to enhance player connections, safety, and the social gaming experience. The suite includes enhancements to Vivox Voice and Text Chat, integration of Safe Voice for moderation capabilities, and the addition of Friends and Leaderboards SDK for fostering in-game relationships and competition. The 2023 Toxicity in Multiplayer Games Report reveals an increase in toxic behavior among players. Triangle Factory and Hi-Rez Studios are among the companies that have integrated Unity's solutions into their games.
